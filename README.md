I have found [PyVideo](http://pyvideo.org/) to be immensely useful for me. It is a website that collects and organized conference talks about the Python programming language.
I wanted a similar site for blockchain tech. So, I built one.
As of this writing [BlockchainVids.net](https://blockchainvids.net/) has organized links to over 1000 talks about blockchain and cryptocurrency technology. Videos links are categorized by event, speaker, and tagged for subjects covered. I intent to include mostly conference, meetup, and class room talks. Right now, the site only supports Youtube but other services can be added as needed.
The site is generated by the Hugo static site generator. The “backend” is just a collection of JSON files that are available on [github](https://github.com/jrigden/blockchainvids.net-posts). This means that anyone can edit or contribute to these files. Making it kind of a static site wiki for blockchain videos. Any contribution is very welcome.
Hopefully, people will find this site useful and will feel welcome to contribute for video links.
